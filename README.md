This project  was made during the Digital Innovation One bootcamp, where it was proposed to make a clone of Netflix. My first idea was to make a clone based on the magical world of Harry Potter, where we can find all movies and documentaries about such universe, simply and quickly.

### ðŸ’» Tenologies
This project was made using basic principles of HTML, CSS and JS. For the carousel part, was made by a jQuery  plugin, [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/). 

### ðŸŽ¨ Design
For me the design of the website is the funniest part to do, so I really enjoyed to make it. All the images and posters resources that i used was from the [The Movie Data Base](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=pt-BR). 

You can also check by yourself where [WizardFlix](https://italomedici.github.io/WizardFlix/).

The project is not done yet, there's some improvements that I want to make, so if you find some bug or have an idea, be free to make a pull request!
